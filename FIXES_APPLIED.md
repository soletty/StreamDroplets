# Stream Droplets Tracker - Critical Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ **CRITICAL: Wrong Events Being Tracked**
**Issue:** The original indexer was tracking generic `Transfer` and `PricePerShareUpdated` events instead of the StreamVault-specific events.

**Fix:** Created `StreamVaultIndexer.ts` that tracks the correct events:
- `Stake(address indexed account, uint256 amount, uint256 round)`
- `Unstake(address indexed account, uint256 amount, uint256 round)`  
- `Redeem(address indexed account, uint256 share, uint256 round)`
- `InstantUnstake(address indexed account, uint256 amount, uint256 round)`
- `RoundRolled(...)` - replaces PricePerShareUpdated

### 2. ❌ **CRITICAL: No Contract Address Filtering**
**Issue:** Vault contracts themselves could earn droplets, skewing calculations.

**Fix:** 
- Added `excluded_addresses` table in migration
- Pre-populated with vault contracts, zero address, burn address
- Modified `AccrualEngine` to check excluded addresses
- Added filtering in `StreamVaultIndexer` during event processing

### 3. ⚠️ **Environment Variable Handling**
**Issue:** Using hardcoded fallbacks instead of failing when critical env vars missing.

**Fix:** 
- `StreamVaultIndexer` now throws errors if required env vars are missing
- Proper validation in constructor

### 4. ✅ **Alchemy getLogs Optimization**
**Already Correct:** The implementation was already using `getLogs` efficiently with:
- Specific contract addresses
- Specific event signatures
- Conservative batch size (100 blocks)
- This is the recommended approach per Alchemy docs

### 5. ✅ **Droplet Calculation Logic**
**Already Correct:** The USD-based calculation follows the spec correctly:
- Uses shares at round start
- Multiplies by PPS
- Converts to USD using Chainlink oracles
- Applies rate per USD per round

## New Files Created

1. **`backend/src/indexer/StreamVaultIndexer.ts`**
   - Proper event tracking for StreamVault contract
   - Contract address filtering
   - Environment variable validation

2. **`backend/src/db/migrations/003_stream_vault_events.ts`**
   - Adds `unstake_events` table
   - Adds `excluded_addresses` table
   - Updates schema for proper event tracking

3. **`backend/src/scripts/validate-implementation.ts`**
   - Comprehensive validation script
   - Checks environment variables
   - Validates contract events
   - Tests database schema
   - Verifies excluded addresses

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/src/accrual/AccrualEngine.ts`**
   - Added `isExcludedAddress()` method
   - Filters excluded addresses in `calculateDroplets()`
   - Filters excluded addresses in `getLeaderboard()`

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- ✅ Uses Alchemy's `getLogs` with specific addresses and events (no scanning all blocks)
- ✅ Batch processing with 100 block chunks
- ✅ Parallel processing of Ethereum and Sonic chains
- ✅ Proper database indexes for fast queries

### Correctness
- ✅ Tracks correct StreamVault events
- ✅ Excludes contract addresses from earning droplets
- ✅ Handles round-based accrual correctly
- ✅ Proper unstake tracking for round exclusion

### Reliability
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Contract existence checks
- ✅ Retry logic for failed transactions
- ✅ Idempotent event processing (using tx_hash + log_idx)

## Running the Fixed Implementation

1. **Run database migrations:**
```bash
cd backend
npx knex migrate:latest
```

2. **Validate the setup:**
```bash
npm run validate
# or
npx ts-node src/scripts/validate-implementation.ts
```

3. **Start the new indexer:**
```bash
npx ts-node src/indexer/StreamVaultIndexer.ts
```

4. **Start the API server:**
```bash
npm start
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are loaded from .env
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Validation script passes all checks
- [ ] Indexer starts and finds contracts
- [ ] Events are properly indexed
- [ ] Contract addresses don't earn droplets
- [ ] Leaderboard excludes contract addresses
- [ ] API endpoints return correct data

## Notes

1. **Deployment Blocks:** Update the starting blocks in `StreamVaultIndexer.initialize()` to the actual deployment blocks instead of `currentBlock - 1000n`

2. **Sonic RPC:** Currently using public RPC for Sonic. When Alchemy supports Sonic, update the RPC URL.

3. **Rate Limiting:** The current batch size of 100 blocks is conservative. Can be increased if needed based on RPC limits.

4. **Monitoring:** Add proper monitoring for:
   - Indexer lag
   - Failed events
   - Oracle staleness
   - API response times
